# Create Classic Token - Quick Steps

The fine-grained token is being difficult. Let's use a classic token instead (much simpler!):

## Steps:

1. **Go to**: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. **Click**: "Generate new token" → **"Generate new token (classic)"** (important - must be classic!)
3. **Name**: `Dashboard Push`
4. **Expiration**: Choose 90 days or "No expiration"
5. **Select scopes**: Check ✅ **`repo`** (this gives full repository access - read and write)
6. **Scroll down** and click **"Generate token"**
7. **Copy the token** immediately (you'll only see it once!)

The token will look like: `ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`

Then share it with me and I'll push your code!

**Why classic tokens?** They're simpler - just check "repo" and you're done. Fine-grained tokens need specific repository access configured, which is more complex.
